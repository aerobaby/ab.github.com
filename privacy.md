# Privacy Policy
*2019-11-19*

Hello! Welcome to the AeroBaby Privacy Policy. It was last updated November 19, 2019.

AeroBaby is committed to protecting your privacy. We take privacy seriously at AeroBaby and this policy is designed to share what information we collect and how we use it.

AeroBaby may change or update the Privacy Policy at any time as we add new or different features, or as the law changes. Unless another date is given, the changes are effective upon posting. If we make a material change to this policy and we have your parent email address we will contact you to notify you before making the changes. You should review the Privacy Policy frequently. This Privacy Policy is also part of the Terms of Service that explain your rights and responsibilities and AeroBaby’s when using AeroBaby’s services and sites. If you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, you should not use the sites and services. If you have any questions please contact us at: aerobaby.games@gmail.com.

## What Kind of Information is Collected?
There are two types of data that may be collected. The first one is called personal data. This is personally identifiable information that identifies a user as an individual. AeroBaby does not collect personal data in any of its kids apps. AeroBaby may collect personal data that parents voluntarily provide on the website. The second type is non personal data which doesn’t directly identify an individual or which may have been personal information but has had the personally identifiable information removed. AeroBaby may collect non personal information about the use of the website and apps to help us improve our services.

## More about Personal Data
We collect personal data when a parent subscribes to a newsletter or alert, submits content to a forum or blog, or requests technical support. This data may include a name (screen or nickname), gender, birth date, and email address. This information may be used to contact parents about new services and features and to send push notifications if consent to receive them has been given. If you contact us for help we will only use your email address to reply to your question.

Please note that if a parent posts personal information about themselves in a community forum or blog in the parent section, in addition to being collected, this data is made public for others to see. The parent is responsible for the disclosure of any such data in those forums.

AeroBaby may also use third parties from time to time to deliver a service, such as payment processing, sending emails, or helping with customer or technical support. We only work with companies that follow this privacy policy and agree not to use your information for any other purposes. If you’d like more information on this, please contact us at aerobaby.games@gmail.com.

We collect minimal personal data from parents who wish to provide it, and some nonpersonal data for internal use only or in conjunction with third parties to help us operate, analyze, and improve our sites and services. In addition, we may disclose your personal or nonpersonal information to additional parties if we believe we are required to by law, by a judicial proceeding, to protect AeroBaby’s rights and properties, or to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringement, and any other conduct that might be illegal or expose AeroBaby or a user of its services to legal liability. In addition, AeroBaby may disclose your information in the event of a change or proposed change in the ownership of the company; for example, a sale, a merger, or bankruptcy.

Parents may disclose information about themselves by posting in the public forums on the site. AeroBaby is not responsible for what parents say and post in these sections.

## Tracking
AeroBaby does not track you; that is, AeroBaby does not collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services. The AeroBaby websites and apps do not employ technology that responds to browser signals that permit users to limit tracking.

## Links 
We may include links to third parties from our website or services. AeroBaby isn’t responsible for these companies and including a link to them doesn’t mean that AeroBaby endorses them. So be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them. And remember, your use of AeroBaby’s sites and services may also be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of other services that AeroBaby doesn’t control such as mobile application stores, mobile software platforms, online social media sites, or payment processors.

## Security
AeroBaby uses generally accepted security measures and safeguards in an attempt to keep the data it collects secure and requires that the third parties it works with agree to do the same. The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for AeroBaby, using a fire-wall protected environment, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said, AeroBaby cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
